# ChatGPT Discord Bot

A powerful Discord bot powered by ChatGPT that helps your server members quickly understand and discuss content from various sources. Whether it's a YouTube video, an article, or a Wikipedia page, the bot provides concise, accurate summaries to keep your community informed and engaged.

Developer notes:

This project was made through vibe coding as a test to see if it's possible to make an app completely from scratch using Cursor. Hopefully you find some of the features useful! (and not totally borked too, haha)
